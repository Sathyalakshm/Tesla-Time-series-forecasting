This project investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting, specifically in predicting Tesla's stock price. Leveraging a historical data set of Tesla stock prices, we design and implement a Time Series Forecasting Framework using various LLM models, including Time GPT, and compare their performance with traditional time series forecasting techniques. Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM models in capturing complex patterns and trends in financial data, identify the most accurate model for stock price prediction, and analyze the impact of hyperparameters on LLM models in financial forecasting. Our results show that Gen AI and LLM models can outperform traditional techniques in forecasting accuracy, providing insights into their potential in revolutionizing financial forecasting and analysis. This study contributes to the growing field of AI in finance, with implications for investors, analysts, and researchers seeking to leverage advanced machine learning techniques for stock price prediction.
